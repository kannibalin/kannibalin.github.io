Malin Sundelin, Art Director from Sundsvall living in Stockholm. Together with my collegues at [Hey It's Enrico Pallazzo](http://www.heyitsenricopallazzo.se/) I make [strange things happen](http://www.heyitsenricopallazzo.se/cases/). I like crispy weird, pastel colours, snus, and [rederiet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rederiet). I'm always looking for freelance offers I can't refuse, send me an email and I will fuck up your scedule.
