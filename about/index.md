My name is Malin Sundelin. I'm 28 years old and I study at Reklamskolan in Gothenburg to be an Art Director. Right now I work as an intern at [Hey it's Enrico Pallazzo](http://www.heyitsenricopallazzo.se/ ). I’m a huge fan of french fries and weird stuff. Do you have a freelanceoffer I can’t refuse? Send me an email and I’ll help you screw up your schedule!
