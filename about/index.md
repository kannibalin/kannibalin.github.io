Malin Sundelin, Art Director & Graphic Designer living in Stockholm, with my heart up north. Together with my collegues at Sveriges Elevk√•rer and [Nattskiftet](http://www.nattskiftet.org/) I make strange things happen. I like crispy weird, pastel colours, snus and [Rederiet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rederiet). I'm always looking for offers I can't refuse!
