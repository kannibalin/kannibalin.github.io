My name is Malin Sundelin, Creative & Art Director from Gothenburg.  I’m a huge fan of french fries and slightly disturbed stuff. Together with my collegues at [Hey It's Enrico Pallazzo](http://www.heyitsenricopallazzo.se/) I make [strange things happen](http://www.heyitsenricopallazzo.se/cases/). Do you have a freelanceoffer I can’t refuse? Send me an [email](mailto:mother.superior@heyitsenricopallazzo.com) and I’ll help you screw up your schedule!
