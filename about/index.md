My real name is Malin Sundelin. I'm 28 years old and I study at Reklamskolan in Gothenburg to be an Art Director. My latest internship was at the former pr-agency [Studio Total](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_Total) and I also worked as an intern at the [Nordic Society for Invention and Discovery](http://www.nordicinvention.com/). Right now I go under the name Mother Superior at [Hey it's Enrico Pallazzo](http://www.heyitsenricopallazzo.se/ ) I like snus, Sven, SNES and I have a [not so ugly dog](/static/bengan.jpg).
