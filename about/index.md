My real name is Malin Sundelin. I'm 28 years old and I study at Reklamskolan in Gothenburg to be an Art Director. My latest internship was at the former pr-agency Studio Total and I am now looking for internship-offers I can't refuse. Starting from Mars 17th. I like snus, Sven, SNES and I have a not so ugly dog.
