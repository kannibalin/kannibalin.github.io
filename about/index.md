My name is Malin Sundelin, creative & art director from Sundsvall, living in Gothenburg.  I’m a huge fan of french fries and slightly disturbed stuff. Together with my collegues at Hey It's Enrico Pallazzo I make strange things happen. Do you have a freelanceoffer I can’t refuse? Send me an email and I’ll help you screw up your schedule!
