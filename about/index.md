My name is Malin Sundelin. I'm 28 years old and I study at Reklamskolan in Gothenburg to be an Art Director. Right now I work as an intern (AD trainee) at [Monki](http://www.monki.com/ ). I’m a huge fan of french fries and slightly disturbed stuff. Do you have a freelanceoffer I can’t refuse? Send me an email and I’ll help you screw up your schedule!
