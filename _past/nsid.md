During my internship (2013) at the [Nordic Society for Invention and Discovery](http://www.nordicinvention.com/)  I helped out with a lot of wierd projects, one of them is the No More Woof. A headset for dogs that pick up the brainwaves from the dog and reads it, calculate it and translate it to human language in easy sentenses like "I'm hungry" for example. I learned a lot of MacGyver-stuff from NSID and I now belive I can build anything out of almost nothing. I also worked with the [Aalto Puck](http://www.aaltopuck.com/) and the [Misery Vodka](http://miseryvodka.com/).
