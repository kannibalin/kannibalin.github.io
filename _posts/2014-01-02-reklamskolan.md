I started my studies to become an Art Director at Reklamskolan in Gothenburg 2012 and I will graduate in December 2014.

When creating a concept for West Pride in school we wanted to put up a fight against intolerance and bigotry. By making West Pride the cure of diseases like these we gave everyone the chance to start medicating for a better world. This is what our print looked like.
