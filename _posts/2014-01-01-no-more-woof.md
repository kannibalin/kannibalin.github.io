Ever wonder what your dog is thinking? When working as an intern at Studio Total I helped out with the project No More Woof which is a headset for dogs that pick up the brainwaves from the dog and reads it, calculate it and translating it to human language in easy sentenses like "IÂ´m hungry".

The No More Woof is still a prototype.
