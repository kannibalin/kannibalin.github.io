During my internship (2013) at the [Nordic Society for Invention and Discovery](http://www.nordicinvention.com/)  I helped out with the project No More Woof which is a headset for dogs that pick up the brainwaves from the dog and reads it, calculate it and translate it to human language in easy sentenses like "I'm hungry" for example. I helped out with the prototype of the headset, the organizing of the photoshoots and most of all I was their number one dog-model-agency.
