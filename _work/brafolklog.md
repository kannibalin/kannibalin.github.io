On an HR fair where people want to check as many seminars and stands as possible you don't always get time to eat. It's hard to get good and fast food. We made a booth with a BRAFOLK-O-MAT, a vending machine where visitors were asked to fill in their email address to get a free good lunch to go, and a business card with contact information to the good folks at Premier (our customer).
