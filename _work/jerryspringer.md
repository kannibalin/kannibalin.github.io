During WOWHack 2014 our team built the game Jerry Springer. It's a platforming endless runner game and you play it inside Spotify. The boxes you have to run and jump on to survive are smaller or bigger depending on the song you are listening to. At the moment Jerry Springer is (unfortunately) not avalible to play but you can at least see what it looked like.
