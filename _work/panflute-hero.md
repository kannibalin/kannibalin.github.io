During WOWHack 2013 our team built the game Panflute Hero. You play it exactly like Guitar Hero but with a panflute instead of a guitar! I was the Art Director/Designer and I worked with my friends aka 3D programmers and coders from heaven who actually built a real flute with bamboo and connected it to a Raspberry Pi. More about Panflute Hero [here](http://www.pixelfolders.se/2014/WOWHack-2013.html), [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jKsvDZP4T0) and [here](http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/5924).
