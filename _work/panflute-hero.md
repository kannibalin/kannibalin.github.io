During WOWHack 2013 our team built the game Panflute Hero. You play it exactly like Guitar Hero but with a panflute instead of a guitar! I was the Art Director/Designer and I worked with my friends aka 3D programmers and coders from heaven who actually built a real flute with bamboo and connected it to a Raspberry Pi.
