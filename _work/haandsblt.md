Snow Beast Laser Tornado is a 2014 platforming video game developed and published by BDG* for iPhone iOS. The game is based on Sara-Lovise Ewertsons clothing collection Snow Beast Laser Tornado’s seven outfits and the design is inspired by nostalgic 90's games combined with some fresh elements. Beta version released on apple AppStore 2014 but there are still some glitches that we are working on at the moment!
