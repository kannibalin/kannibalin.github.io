On a school project we created a campaign for the West Pride festival in Gothenburg. Our idea was to use the festival as a cure and also borrow graphic elements from the medicin world. There are still today some people that thinks HBTQ-people need to be cured. We believe that is crazy and if you think that way YOU need to be cured! Maybe by a festival? 


“West Pride is an over-the-counter drug that cures bigotry, Putin Disease and other bitter plagues. It can also be used to treat intolerance and symptooms of confusion. While West Pride is effective against serious problems, it also relieves everyday worries, such as boredom and irritation; it lightens up a bad day and it works as an antidepressant. Like all medicines, West Pride can cause side effects, particularly when you first start taking it.
    The must common side effects (affects 99 people in 100) are strong rejoicing and a feeling of easy intoxication, you can be caught off guard by a sudden urge to dance. There is a clear risk that perfectly healthy people develop a side effect addiction. The only way to get rid of the temptation is to yield to it. Therefore it is reccomended to visit West Pride 2014 between 28 May and 1 June at Kungsportsplatsen, Gotnenburg.”
